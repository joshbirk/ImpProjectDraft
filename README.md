#Project: Salesforce Smart Refrigerator

The following Trailhead project will use an Electric Imp to monitor a refrigerator and a Salesforce *Connected App* to track the current temperature and humidity in the fridge.  This example will also *open a case* in Salesforce if:  1) the refrigerator door is open for more than 30 seconds, or 2) the temperature remains over 11Â°C for more than 15 min, or 3) the relative humidity is over 70% for more than 15 min.  To track the current temperature and humidity we will create a Salesforce *custom object*, then update it with new readings every 15 sec.
