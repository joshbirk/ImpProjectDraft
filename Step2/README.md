#Step 2: Add Code for the Electric Imp

### How Electric Imp's cloud based programming works
(Brief blurb here from EI)


### Electric Imp IDE / Code
 - In your favorite web browser log into the [Electric Imp IDE](https://ide.electricimp.com/login)
 - Click the *Create New Model* button
 - In the pop up name your code model, select your device and click *Create Model* button
 - Copy and paste the Salesforce Trailhead example code into the agent and device coding windows.  The agent.nut file should go in the agent coding window, the device.nut file in the device coding window.
 - In the sidebar select your device (this should open up a device logs window under the agent and device coding windows)
 - At the top of your agent coding window there is now an agent url. It will look something like this ```"https://agent.electricimp.com/szPc0sLfAqlu"```
 - Make a note of your agent url. You will need the it when creating your connected app in Salesforce.
