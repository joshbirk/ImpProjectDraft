#Step 5: Build and Run the Electric Imp Application

These examples use OAuth 2.0 for authentication, so the agent has been set up as a web server to handle the log in.
Go to the Electric Imp IDE and select your device from the sidebar for the final setup steps.

- Hit **Build and Run** to save and launch the code
- Click on the agent url (at the top of the agent coding window) to launch the log in page
- Log into salesforce

Your App should now be up and running.  You can monitor the device logs in the IDE, or log into Salesforce to see updates there.
